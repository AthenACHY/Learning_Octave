% to create a Lesile matrix for age-structured population. %
% We can compute how each age class grow in a population given we know the transition rate between class and the reproductive rate of each class %

% write a function that can take in Lesile matrix and the initial population at any sizes and output the population after n time-steps %
% The population grows as L^t *n for each time step
