Input matirx:
input matrix starting with [ , with row orientations seperated by ; , ends with ].
E.g.
## input R as a 2 row x 3 col matrix
R = [-1 1 0;
     0 -1 1]
     
Transpose R is commanded by adding ' = R'     
so R * R' = [2 -1;
             -1 2]
             
Performing arimetric:
A=[1 0; 1 1]
B=[5 0; 4 1]
A * B = [5 0;
         9 1]
         
B' * A' = [5 9;
           0 1]         

inverse matrix = inv(A)
